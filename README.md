# Cut.js (alpha)

Cut.js (name inspired from "cutout animation") is a minimal JavaScript library for making optimized HTML5 games and visual apps from image textures.

Cut.js targets mobile devices and modern browsers and provides dynamic and intractable visual composition functionalities but it is not a physics or all-in-one game engine.
